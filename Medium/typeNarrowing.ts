/* Type narrowing is how TypeScript figures out the exact type of a variable when there are 
multiple possible types (like in union types). */

/* Create a function logValue(value: number | string) that:

If the value is a number, multiplies it by 2.

If itâ€™s a string, prints it in uppercase.

Call this function with both a number and a string. */
